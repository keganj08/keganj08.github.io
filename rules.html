            <h1>Cards</h1>
            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>Every card has a picture, a title, and a description of its effect. Some cards also have a label such as "Player Effect" 
                    when appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Targets</h2>
                <p>There are two types of cards: <i>Target Cards</i> and <i>Neutral Cards</i>.</p>
                <p><i>Target Cards</i> are cards that specify an action that must be carried out <span class="ex">(Ex: “Fall Out of a Treehouse, Lose 50 
                    pts”).</span> Minion Cards also fall under this category. You may play these cards on Yourself or An Opponent. Some cards specify that 
                    they must be played on a certain target- always follow the instructions on the card. If a card requires you to flip a coin or roll a die 
                    before its effect takes place, you must choose a target before determining the result.</p>
                <p><i>Neutral Cards</i> are cards that either affect everyone equally <span class="ex">(Ex: “All Batteries Fire, Fire! All players lose 150 
                    pts”)</span> or do not require any choice <span class="ex">(Ex: “Red Shell, The next player misses their next turn and loses 50 
                    pts”).</span> These cards are not played on any one person, but rather played to the board. Some cards preclude the targeting of a 
                    specific player <span class="ex">(Ex: “Forced Treaty: You and the user may not play cards on each other.”)</span>; neutral cards that 
                    affect this player may still be played.</p>
                <p>To target a player’s minion you must be able to target its owner. All minions are a sub-target of their owner. If a minion has Taunt, they 
                    must be targeted instead of the corresponding player or any of their other minions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Card Types</h2>
                <p>Cards are categorized as either <i>Point</i>, <i>Effect</i>, <i>Reaction</i>, <i>Minion</i>, or <i>Special</i>.</p>
                <p><i>Point Cards</i> have either a positive or negative point value. When they’re played, the player being targeted gains or loses that many points. 
                    <span class="ex">(Ex: “You Get the Mustang For the Night, +150 pts”)</span>
                <p><i>Effect Cards</i> introduce a new effect to the game. Some are temporary, while others are permanent. These effects can grant points on every turn, 
                    change an aspect of gameplay, and more. These cards are further categorized as either <i>Player Effects</i> or <i>Board Effects</i>. Player effects 
                    impact only one player, whereas board effects can impact all players. <span class="ex">(Ex: “Off Your Phone! The next player to go on their phone 
                    loses 1000 pts”)</span></p>
                <p><i>Reaction Cards</i> are played immediately after a certain condition is met, usually when another player plays a card, instead of on your turn. 
                    <span class="ex">(Ex: “Oh, I Don’t Think So. Cancel a card played by another player”)</span></p>
                <p><i>Minion Cards</i> are like effect cards, but can only be removed by lowering its health to 0. Each minion has a starting health and a maximum 
                    health. Players can remove health by making the minion lose points and give health by making it gain points. A minion’s health cannot exceed its 
                    maximum health and is discarded once its health reaches 0. Unless specified otherwise, a minion performs its effect on your turn, every turn. 
                    <span class="ex">(Ex: “Sunflower: Each turn, draw a card. Health: 50, Max Health: 150”)</span></p>
                <p><i>Special Cards</i> are any cards that don’t fall into any of these categories. They usually allow actions such as drawing cards or cancelling 
                    another player’s action. <span class="ex">(Ex: “Card Magnet, Draw 2 cards”)</span></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Tiers</h2>
                <p>The cards are divided into 4 tiers: <i>Common</i>, <i>Rare</i>, <i>Epic</i>, and <i>Legendary</i>. The tiers are simply a way to identify a card’s 
                    general value or ability to impact the game. You can tell a card’s tier by the color of the circle in the top right corner.</p>
                <p><i>Common Cards</i> are represented by the color green. They tend to be point cards with values ranging from 50-150 or relatively insignificant 
                    effect cards.</p>
                <p><i>Rare Cards</i> are represented by the color orange. They tend to be point cards with values ranging from 150-250 or cards that offer some 
                    strategic potential.</p>
                <p><i>Epic Cards</i> are represented by the color blue. They tend to have significant point values, effects, or other abilities that make them very 
                    useful.</p>
                <p><i>Legendary Cards</i> are represented by the color purple. They have the potential to make a large impact on the game through very high point 
                    values, powerful effects, or rare abilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Non-Deck Cards</h2>
                <p>Some cards are not in the deck, but rather influence the game in another way. There are two types of such cards: <i>Ages</i> and <i>Heroes</i>.</p>
                <p><i>Ages</i> are permanent board effects that cannot be removed using regular methods. If playing with Ages, all Ages are shuffled in a separate 
                    deck at the beginning of the game with the top card face-up. When an age is face-up, its effect applies to everyone in the game <span class="ex">
                    (Ex: “April 16th, 2000: All coin flip / die roll effects are doubled”)</span>. To “advance an age” means discard the top card of the Ages deck and 
                    flip the next card face-up. To “regress an age” means flip the top card face-down and put the most recently discarded age on top.</p>
                
                <p><i>Heroes</i> are permanent player effects that cannot be removed using regular methods. If playing with Heroes, each player draws a random Hero at 
                    the beginning of the game and only they may use its effect. Some cards let you draw a new hero; in this case, randomly draw from the Heroes deck 
                    before returning your old Hero. Some cards give you a special Hero that cannot be obtained via other means <span class="ex">(Ex: “Curse of the 
                    Amulet: Swap your Hero with Hamulet”)</span>. These Heroes are not included in the Heroes deck and are kept in a separate pile.</p>
            </div>

            <h1>How To Play</h1>
            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>A dealer will start by dealing everyone around 7 cards. The number of starting cards can be changed based on the number of players. Next the player 
                    to the left of the dealer starts their turn. Once their turn is done, play continues clockwise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Taking Your Turn</h2>
                <p>You always start your turn by drawing a card from the deck. Then you choose a card from your hand to play. You must play a card each turn. When you 
                    play a card, you place it face-up in the discard pile next to the deck. The only exception to this is for Effect cards, which are left out until 
                    their effect is finished, or Minion cards, which are left out until defeated. Once a card has been placed it must be played and can not be taken 
                    back for any reason. Unless otherwise specified, you may only play one card per turn.</p>
                <p>If you have a card in your hand that says “Must play immediately,” play it on your turn after you draw a card. Unless the card says otherwise, these 
                    can only be played on yourself. If you have multiple “Must play immediately” cards, you may choose which one to play. Any player who is caught 
                    holding onto a “Must play immediately” is penalized 500 points. If the same player does this twice in one game they are eliminated.</p>
                <p>Certain cards, such as “Reaction” cards, may be played any time in response to another player’s card- even when it isn’t your turn.</p>
                <p>If you have no cards that may be played, you must discard a card instead. This is the only time you may choose to discard a card.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p>Some cards have effects that “kill” a player; from this point forward, this player is a <i>Ghost</i>. Upon turning into a ghost, the player must 
                    discard all active player effects. While a ghost, the player’s score cannot change, they cannot use their minions, they cannot gain player effects, 
                    and most importantly, they cannot win the game.</p>
                <p>On their turn a ghost may play a card normally or they may <i>Haunt</i>. A ghost can haunt an opponent by discarding a card to make them lose 50 
                    points. When a player is revived they are no longer a ghost and all regular rules once again apply.</p>
                <p>If all players are ghosts at the end of the game, the ghost with the highest score wins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Endgame</h2>
                <p>Once there are no more cards left in the deck, everyone takes one last turn where no cards are drawn (including the player who drew the final card.) 
                    Anything that would have happened after this turn, such as a player missing their next turn, gets cut off. After everyone has taken their last turn, 
                    the player with the most points wins!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chunk">
                <h2>Team Variant</h2>
                <p>1000 Blank White Cards may be played in teams! Each team must have an equal number of players, but there is no limit on the number of teams nor on 
                    the number of players comprising a team. Each team’s members must be staggered equally in the turn order. For example, if there are teams A, B, and 
                    C, each with members 1 and 2, the turn order must go A1-B1-C1-A2-B2-C2. There are two main rule changes. First, each team gets one combined score 
                    rather than individual player scores. Note that this means no two teammates are considered opponents. Second, after each completed round, each 
                    player passes a card to the closest team member to their left. Whichever team has the highest score at the end of the game wins.</p>
            </div>

            <h1>Creating New Cards</h1>
            <div class="chunk">
                <p>Every card must have a picture (you don’t have to be an artist!) and a description of its effect. Titles are also recommended. Beyond this, it is 
                    strongly encouraged that you follow a few guidelines to help your card fit into the game better.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Certain types of cards must have special markings on them to make their purpose clear. These include <i>“Nope” Cards</i>, <i>“Deflect” 
                        Cards</i>, and <i>“Must play immediately” Cards</i>. Refer to existing cards for examples of what markings to include on your card.</li>

                    <li>Cards should not have excessively powerful effects, such as “You win the game” cards. These cards are generally not very fun to play with and 
                        go against the spirit of the game.</li>
                
                    <li>Overly complicated cards can be too confusing to play with. Try to limit your cards to one main effect that can be easily explained in a few 
                        sentences.</li>
                </ul>
